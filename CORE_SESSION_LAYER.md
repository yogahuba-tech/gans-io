# Core Session Layer (Fixed)

This structure NEVER changes. It serves as the frozen framework for all YogiAI sessions.

1. **Joint Opening (3–6 min)**
   - **Neck**: All directions (up/down, right/left), count-based (3 to 14).
   - **Shoulders**: Forward and backward rotations (1 to 7).
   - **Wrists**: Hand extensions, rotations in both directions (1 to 12).
   - **Pelvic rotation**: Slow and controlled rotations (1 to 7).
   - **Ankle rotation**: Individual pair rotations.

2. **Standing Prep**
   - **Wall-facing awareness**: Establishing connection with the space.
   - **Arm movements**: L-shape arm rotations (1 to 10).
   - **Space creation**: Positioning feet at hip distance.

3. **Surya Namaskar**
   - **Exact inhale–exhale logic**: Breathing dictates the movement.
   - **Sequence**: Knee–chest–chin → Bhujangasana → Parvatasana.
   - **Right–Left symmetry**: Always complete both sides.
   - **Count-based continuity**: Maintaining the rhythm.

4. **Repetition & Rhythm**
   - **Symmetry**: Same pattern, different leg.
   - No imbalance in practice.

5. **Controlled Ending**
   - **Namaskarasan**: Final centering.
   - **Breath normalization**: Returning to natural rhythm.

### Flexibility within Fixed Structure
We freeze this structure and only change:
- **Focus** (e.g., Foundation, Hips, Core, Backbends, Strength)
- **Cue emphasis**
- **Micro-variations**
- **Stress load**
