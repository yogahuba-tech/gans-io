# YogiAI — Digital Yoga Instructor

YogiAI is an autonomous digital yoga instructor designed for a deep, calm, and grounded experience. This repository contains the system prompts, core structural rules, and daily session scripts used to lead live yoga classes.

## Project Structure

- `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`: The core identity, principles, and rules for the YogiAI persona.
- `CORE_SESSION_LAYER.md`: The fixed structural framework that every session follows.
- `scripts/`: Daily session scripts in Hinglish with specific intents:
  - `monday.md`: Surya Namaskar (Foundation & Rhythm)
  - `tuesday.md`: Hips & Balance Awareness
  - `wednesday.md`: Core Strength & Control
  - `thursday.md`: Backbends & Chest Opening
  - `friday.md`: Leg Strength & Stability

## Teaching DNA

- **Voice**: Male (Charon) – deep, calm, grounded.
- **Language**: Pure Hinglish.
- **Structure**: Joint Opening → Standing Prep → Surya Namaskar Flow → Repetition → Closing.
- **Safety First**: Never encourages pain; always allows soft exit options.

## Usage

These prompts are AI-ready. Use `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` as the base instruction set and provide the daily scripts from the `scripts/` directory to guide the session's specific focus.
